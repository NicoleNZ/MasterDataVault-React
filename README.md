# MasterDataVault-React

The Master Data Vault 

This project allows users to create, find, update and delete product master data - all in one place.

What Is "Product Master Data" You Ask?
Product Master Data (or just Master Data if you're in the biz) is a set of information which contains all of the key attributes that pertain to an indididual SKU or product. The master data of a parcular item can include a huge range of attributes, such as the product name, the supplier code, barcodes, net and gross weights, nutritional information, hazardous substance classification codes, sizes, materials, recyclability and so much more. Imagine it as an individual passport for inanimate objects.

Motivation 
I created this project officially for one of my General Assembly assigments, but the concept itself is actually something very close to my heart - as I work with master data all the time in my work and just ADORE it when it is all tidy and correct and kept safely away from tampering! People like me tend to get very territorial over their master data.

Installation 
Super easy - just clone this repo, hit npm install then npm start in both a client terminal and a server terminal.  You will automatically see a browser pop up with the UI, and boom! You're ready to go!

Credits 
Big thanks to my instructors Ash, Stacey and Pradosh at GA Sydney for teaching me how to create my first full stack project!
